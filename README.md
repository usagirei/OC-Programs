## LibPack

Minify, compress, and bundle a script and its `require`d dependencies into a single standalone .lua file
Comes with 3 scripts:
* luamin: minifies a single lua script
* luascan: launches a lua script, and intercepts require calls to build a .luapack definition
* luapack: reads a .luapack definition in the current directory, manually created or generated by luascan, and creates a single bundled .lua file

## LibApp

Declarative GUI Application Library (WIP). <br >
See the [demos](libapp/data/demos) for sample applications. <br >
The [tarball install floppy script](misc/setup/setup_full.lua) was written with it, and then bundled with [LibPack](#libpack) <br >
OCEmu, VSCode+LuaLS extension recommended for application development, so you get code completion from the LuaDoc comments.
